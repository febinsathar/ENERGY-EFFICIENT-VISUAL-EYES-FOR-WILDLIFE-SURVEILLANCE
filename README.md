ENERGY EFFICIENT VISUAL EYES FOR WILDLIFE SURVEILLANCE
Wireless real-time surveillance systems are very valuable for monitoring

ecology of wildlife, since the in-situ situation could be grasped immediately

which can be viewed from anywhere in the world over internet. Power source is 

usually constrained in the wild areas. Thus, in this project, we are planning to 

develop a low power-consumption image transmission system (called energy-
efficient visual eyes system) by integrating a Raspberry Pi board, a digital 

camera, and a USB 3G net-setter, and Wi-Fi dongle. In order to make a 

monitoring system suitable for circumstances of wild islands, the system is 

divided into a base station and associated camera stations so as to overcome 

the limited network coverage is the areas under surveillance. Through this 

project we are trying to bring about a real-time wildlife viewing system for 

efficient wildlife surveillance. Camera captures images and sends it to base 

station. Employing wireless communication technologies to carry out image 

monitoring. Captured images are viewed on an online web-server. Flexibility 

and immediate access of wildlife observation is met through the new system. 

The experimental results show that the system design is feasible to ecological 

monitoring and able to effectively maintain the completeness of images with 

energy efficiency.
